      NITRObot Line following using 5 line detection sensors

 NITRObot is equipped with different sensors and designed to let you simulate tasks from the industrial robotics world. 
 
 In this program, we will use NITRObot's line detecting sensors to perform the line following task 
 similarly to the way it is done in the big industrial robots.
 
 Find the detailed instructions in NITRObot_Line_following_5_sensors-Instructions_EN.docx

The sketch (ino file) is located in  NITRObot_Line_following_5_sensors folder of this repository.

Select "Arduino Mega or Mega 2560" in the Arduino IDE and run the sketch.
 
You can run the same source code in Visual Studio Code editor with PlatformIO extention installed,
by replacing the "ino" file extention with "cpp" file extension and selecting Arduino Mega board for the project.
